                <h3>Toyota Supra MK4 (A80)</h3>

                <p>
                    Regarded as one of the greatest sports cars in history, the fourth-generation Toyota Supra A80 remains highly sought after even 30 years after its initial debut. And the Holy Grail for those in the market is the super rare, Supra MK4. Powered by the legendary Toyota 2JZ engine, the MK4 combined power, a nearly limitless power ceiling, and Toyota reliability.

                <h3>History</h3>

                <p>
                    Running from 1993 to 2002, the A80 saw a nearly complete redesign with the Japanese Automaker putting a larger emphasis on high performance. It saw the introduction of two new engines: a naturally aspirated Toyota 2JZ-GE that put out 220 horsepower and 210 pound-feet of torque and a twin-turbocharged Toyota 2JZ-GTE that put out an impressive for the year, 276 horsepower and 318 pound-feet of torque for the Japanese models.

                <p>
                    It’s one of a handful of JDM performance cars that is responsible for inspiring generations of racers who were born well after the car’s initial debut. Although Toyota re-released the car (with the help of BMW) back in 2019 with the fifth generation, the fourth generation remains just as popular today as it was the day it rolled off the shores of Japan and into U.S. driveways.
